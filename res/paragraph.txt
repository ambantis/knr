	But at what cost have we become slaves to the conspicuous consumption of technology?  So busy working to pay for these ephemeral objects and master their mysteries, in the end we become like early man who put so much time and energy into scraping food out of the land and chasing the swift gazelle that he had no time to lift his eyes to the heavens and ennoble his soul with thoughts beautiful and profound.
I do not wish to divorce myself from all manner of technology, shutting myself within a primitive log cabin in the middle of the wilderness.  But no longer shall I lust after cold objects devoid of humanity.  I wish a life that is physical, not chemical.  Know what I mean?
