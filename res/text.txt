This summer, spend some quality time with your favorite technology in our 2013 summer programming contest!

The Lisp community is awarding prizes for demonstrating interesting and useful programs, technologies and art using any LISP-based technology.

But why lisp? Aside from writing great software faster by beating the averages "Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days".
